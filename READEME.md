# Jaya Optimization  

This repository contains tests using the **Jaya** optimization algorithm in R.  

## Structure  
- **`easy-test/`** – Contains the **Easy Test**, a basic implementation of the Jaya algorithm.  

## Easy Test  
The **Easy Test** applies the Jaya optimization algorithm to minimize a simple mathematical function.  

### Files  
- **`easy-test/easy_test.Rmd`** – R Markdown file with the implementation.  

### Usage  
Navigate to the `easy-test/` folder and run the `.Rmd` file in RStudio to view the results.
